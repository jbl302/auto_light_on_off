# Auto Light On-Off System

This project enables the automatic switching of lights through voice commands, incorporating various technologies such as IFTTT, Telegram Bot, BOLT WiFi module, and Telethon.

## Project Overview

The system is designed to effortlessly control the lighting environment using voice commands via a Telegram Bot. The integration of the BOLT WiFi module facilitates the hardware connection necessary for seamless light switching operations.

## Setup and Configuration

1. **API Hash Generation**: Begin by generating the required API hash through the Telegram Developer website.

2. **Telegram Bot Creation**: Create and configure a Telegram bot to receive commands for light control.

3. **IFTTT Configuration**: Customize the 'if' condition in IFTTT to activate the system in response to specific voice commands.

4. **Code Implementation**: Develop the Python code in your preferred code editor, such as VS Code, for efficient command handling.

5. **Telethon Integration**: Utilize the Telethon library to establish communication between the Telegram Bot and the system.

6. **Request Verification**: Implement a robust verification process to ensure the security and authenticity of incoming commands.

7. **Light Control and PC Shutdown**: Upon successful verification, the system executes the designated BOLT request for light control and initiates a PC shutdown command through the terminal.
