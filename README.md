# auto_light_on_off
In this project i am using IFFT,telegram bot,BOLT wifi module,Telethon.
The hardware connection is done on bolt wifi for light swithching.
We generate api hash in telegram developer website,then create a bot in telegram.
In IFFT the 'if' is set by us to any voice command. 
In then part we provide our bot the request
In vs code or any other code editor we write the python code
We get request in our bot when we give voice command
Using Telethon library we get the request from telegram bot
We verify the request,If it is correct then we send BOLT request to switch off light,and also turn off the PC
